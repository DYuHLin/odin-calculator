# odin-calculator
This will be my final project in the fundemental section of the Odin project. I will be using all the
skills I have learnt and will be doing my own research when completing this project.

# what I learnt
1. I gained a much better understanding of the fundementals and how to reseach what I want when I do not understand something.
2. I learnt about keyboard functionality more in depth, although in this project it is successful, it was very sloppy and I prefer using the mouse to click on the buttons
3. Through this project I did get better at writing the pseudocode aspect of it.
4. My knowledge on event listeners and DOM manipulation was also strengthend.
5. I work better now using classLists, if statements and many of the types of variables I previously struggled in.

# Reflection
This was a fun project to work on. I had done a calculator project before starting the Odin project but I followed a video for that one. With this project I was able to do what I estimate is 80% by myself and my own research. I notice that my js skills have improved a lot more which I am happy about. I need to work on the keyboard event listeners, that part of the code is quite sloppy but the core of the code is pretty good.
I honestly can say that I wanted to follow another video again for this project but I decided against it and did it on my own which was cool.
